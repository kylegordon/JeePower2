White - Signal from ignition


Making the alternator warning lamp usable
-----------------------------------------
The alternator warning lamp works by permanantly supplying +12v to one side of the bulb. 
When the alternator is off, the indicator output acts as a ground (current sink), and sinks the current and thus allows the bulb to light
When the alternator is working, the indicator output rises to 12v as well, thus balancing the 12v supply on both sides of the bulb and causing it to go out.
To compensate for this, a relay with normally open contacts was wired in parallel with the bulb. When the bulb comes on, so does the relay. When the relay is on, the contacts are closed. One side of the contacts has +12v supplied to it, and the other goes to the Arduino input. Subsequently, when 12v is present on both sides of the coil, the arduino gets a low input.
